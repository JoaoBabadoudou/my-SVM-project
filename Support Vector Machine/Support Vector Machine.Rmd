## Introduction 

**Support vector machines (SVMs)** oÔ¨Äer a direct approach to binary classiÔ¨Åcation: 
try to Ô¨Ånd a hyperplane in some feature space that ‚Äúbest‚Äù separates the 
two classes. In practice, however, it is diÔ¨Écult (if not impossible) to Ô¨Ånd a 
hyperplane to perfectly separate the classes using just the original features. 
SVMs overcome this by extending the idea of Ô¨Ånding a separating hyperplane 
in two ways: (1) loosen what we mean by ‚Äúperfectly separates‚Äù, and (2) use 
the so-called kernel trick to enlarge the feature space to the point that perfect separation of classes is (more) likely.






---

## History

---
## Optimal  separating  hyperplanes
 A hyperplane in ùëù-dimensional feature space is deÔ¨Åned by the (linear) equation 
 
 $$ùëì (ùëã)  =  ùõΩ_{0}+ ùõΩ_{1} ùëã_{1}  + ‚ãØ + ùõΩ_{p} ùëã_{p} =  0$$

When $ùëù = 2$, this deÔ¨Ånes a line in 2-D space, and when ùëù = 3, it deÔ¨Ånes a 
plane in 3-D space. By deÔ¨Ånition, for points on one side of 
the hyperplane, $ùëì (ùëã) > 0$, and for points on the other side, $ùëì(ùëã) < 0$. For (mathematical) convenience, we‚Äôll re-encode the binary outcome $Y_{i}$ using {-1, 1} so that $ùëå_{i}√ó ùëì(ùëã_{i}) > 0$ for points on the correct side of the hyperplane. In this context the hyperplane represents a _decision boundary_ that partitions the feature space into two sets, one for each class.

### The hard margin classiÔ¨Åer



.pull-left[
As you might imagine, for two separable classes, there are an inÔ¨Ånite number 
of separating hyperplanes! So which decision boundary is **best**? If you were asked to draw a decision 
boundary with good generalization performance , 
how would it look to you? Naturally, you would probably draw a boundary 
that provides the maximum separation between the two classes, and that‚Äôs 
exactly what the HMC is doing! Well, it depends on how we deÔ¨Åne ‚Äúbest‚Äù.  
The HMC is one such ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù separating hyperplane and the simplest type of 
SVM. The HMC is optimal in the sense that it separates the two classes while 
maximizing the distance to the closest points from either class ]

The decision boundary (i.e., hyperplane) from the HMC separates the 
two classes by maximizing the distance between them. This maximized distance is referred to as the margin ùëÄ.

Geometrically, 
Ô¨Ånding the HMC for two separable classes amounts to the following:
-  Draw  the  convex   hull     around  each  class  
-   Draw  the  shortest  line  segment  that  connects  the  two  convex  hulls 
(this  is  the  dotted  line  segment  ).
-  The  perpendicular  bisector  of  this  line  segment  is  the  HMC!
-   The margin boundaries are formed by drawing lines that pass 
through the support vectors and are parallel to the separating 
hyperplane .

This can also be formulated as an optimization problem. Mathematically speaking, the HMC estimates the coeÔ¨Écients of the hyperplane by solving a quadratic 
programming problem with linear inequality constraints, in particular:

.pull-right[
Put diÔ¨Äerently, the HMC Ô¨Ånds the separating hyperplane that provides 
the largest margin/gap between the two classes. The width of both margin boundaries 
is M. With    the    constraint $\displaystyle \sum_{j=i}^{p} \beta_{j}^2 = 1$  the quantity $\displaystyle y_{i} \left( \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{i1} + ... + \beta_{p}x_{ip} \right)$ represents the distance from the ùëñ-th data point to the decision boundary. Note that the solution to the optimization problem above does not allow any points to be on the wrong side of the margin; 
**hence the term hard margin classiÔ¨Åer**.

### The soft margin classifier

.pull-left[
Sometimes perfect separation is achievable, but not desirable!

While the data are still perfectly separable, the decision boundaries obtained 
using the HMC will not generalize well to new data and accuracy will suÔ¨Äer (i.e., these models are not robust to outliers in the feature space). 

In this situation, we can loosen the constraints (or __soften the margin__ ) by 
allowing some points to be on the wrong side of the margin; this is referred 
to as the the __soft margin classiÔ¨Åer__ (SMC)

The SMC, similar to the HMC, estimates the coeÔ¨Écients of the hyperplane by solving the slightly modiÔ¨Åed optimization problem:


![  ](SMC.png)

Similar to before, the SMC Ô¨Ånds the separating hyperplane that provides the 
largest margin/gap between the two classes, but allows for some of the points 
to cross over the margin boundaries. Here ùê∂ is the allowable budget for the 
total amount of overlap and is our Ô¨Årst tunable hyperparameter for the SVM.

]


.pull-right[


By varying $ùê∂$, we allow points to violate the margin which helps make the SVM 
robust to outliers. Ideally, the hyperplane 
giving the decision boundary with the best generalization performance lies 
somewhere in between these two extremes and can be determined using, for 
example, $k -fold CV$.

## The support vector machine

###### So far, we‚Äôve only used linear decision boundaries. Such a classiÔ¨Åer is likely too restrictive to be useful in practice, especially when compared to other algorithms that can adapt to nonlinear relationships. Fortunately, we can use a simple trick, called the __kernel trick__, to overcome this. A deep understanding of the kernel trick requires an understanding of __kernel functions__ and __reproducing  kernel Hilbert spaces__ . Fortunately, we can use a couple illustrations in 2-D/3-D feature space to drive home the key idea.

In essence, SVMs use the kernel trick to enlarge the feature space using basis 
functions (e.g., like in MARS or polynomial regression). In this enlarged (kernel- 
induced) feature space, a hyperplane can often separate the two classes. The 
resulting decision boundary, which is linear in the enlarged feature space, will 
be nonlinear when transformed back onto the original feature space.
Popular  kernel  functions  used  by  SVMs  include:

‚Ä¢   $d -th$  degree  polynomial:  $ùêæ (ùë•, ùë•‚Ä≤ )  =  ùõæ (1 + ‚ü®ùë•, ùë•‚Ä≤ )^d‚ü©$

‚Ä¢   Radial  basis  function:  $\displaystyle (x, x') = \exp\left(\gamma \| x - x' \|^2 \right)$

‚Ä¢   Hyperbolic  tangent:  $K(x, x') = \tanh \left( k_1 \| x - x' \| + k_2 \right)$

Here  $\langle x, x' \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i x'_i$    is   called   an   inner   product.  

Notice   how   each   of these kernel functions include hyperparameters that need to be tuned. For 
example, the polynomial kernel includes a degree term ùëë and a scale parameter $ùõæ$. Similarly, the radial basis kernel includes a $ùõæ$ parameter related to 
the inverse of the $ùúé$ parameter of a normal distribution. In R, you can use 
`caret`‚Äôs `getModelInfo()` to extract the hyperparameters from various SVM 
implementations with diÔ¨Äerent kernel functions, for example:




---



```{r echo=TRUE, message=TRUE}
#    Linear    (i.e.,    soft    margin    classifier)
caret::getModelInfo("svmLinear")$svmLinear$parameters
```

--

```{r echo=TRUE, message=TRUE}
#    Polynomial    kernel
caret::getModelInfo("svmPoly")$svmPoly$parameters
```

--

```{r echo=TRUE, message=TRUE}
#    Radial    basis    kernel
caret::getModelInfo("svmRadial")$svmRadial$parameters
```



Through the use of various kernel functions, SVMs are extremely Ô¨Çexible 
and capable of estimating complex nonlinear decision boundaries.

### More than two classes

The SVM, as introduced, is applicable to only two classes! What do we do 
when we have more than two classes? There are two general approaches: 
one-versus-al l (OVA) and one-versus-one (OVO). In OVA, we Ô¨Åt an SVM 
for each class (one class versus the rest) and classify to the class for which
the  margin  is  the  largest.  In  OVO,  we  Ô¨Åt  all    pairwise  SVMs  and
classify to the class that wins the most pairwise competitions. All the popular 
implementations of SVMs, including kernlab, provide such approaches to 
multinomial classiÔ¨Åcation.

### Support Vector Regression

The idea  behind  support  vector  regression  (SVR)  is  very  similar:  Ô¨Ånd  a  good  Ô¨Åtting hyperplane  in  a  kernel-induced  feature  space  that  will  have  good  generalization performance  using  the  original  features.  Although  there  are  many  Ô¨Çavors  of SVR,  we‚Äôll  introduce  the  most  common:  __ùúñ-insensitive  loss  regression__


---

Recall  that  the  least  squares  (LS)  approach  to  function  estimation    minimizes the   sum   of   the   squared   residuals,   where   in   general   we   deÔ¨Åne the residual as $ùëü (ùë•, ùë¶) = ùë¶ ‚àí ùëì (ùë•)$. (In ordinary linear regression $ùëì (ùë•) = \beta_ 0 + \beta_ {1} ùë•_ {1} + \dots+ \beta_ pùë•_p)$ .  The problem with LS is that it involves squaring the residuals which gives outliers undue inÔ¨Çuence on the Ô¨Åtted regression function. 
Although we could rely on the MAE metric (which looks at the absolute 
value as opposed to the squared residuals), another intuitive loss metric, called 
__ùúñ-insensitive loss__, is more robust to outliers:

$$
L_{\epsilon}  =  \max(0, |ùëü (ùë•, ùë¶)| ‚àí \epsilon) 
$$

Here $\epsilon$ is a threshold set by the analyst. In essence, we‚Äôre forming a margin 
around the regression curve of width $\epsilon$.


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Create data
set.seed(42)  # For reproducibility
x <- seq(0, 5, length.out = 100)
f_x <- 2 + x * 1.2  # Linear function
epsilon <- 1.5  # Margin

# Create a data frame
df <- data.frame(x = x, f_x = f_x)
ggplot(df, aes(x, f_x)) +
  geom_line(color = "black", size = 1) +  # Main function line
  geom_line(aes(y = f_x + epsilon), linetype = "dashed", color = "darkgreen") +  # Upper bound
  geom_line(aes(y = f_x - epsilon), linetype = "dashed", color = "darkgreen") +  # Lower bound
  annotate("text", x = max(x) - 1, y = max(f_x) + epsilon, label = "f(x) + Œµ", color = "darkgreen", size = 5) +
  annotate("text", x = max(x) - 1, y = min(f_x) - epsilon, label = "f(x) - Œµ", color = "darkgreen", size = 5) +
  labs(x = "x", y = "f(x)")

## Application

In this study, we propose an approach based 
support vector machines (SVM) to detect disease. To this end, we will use 
data retrieved from Kaggle, presenting certain characteristics such as blood pressure or insulin the amount of insulin in the blood of certain individuals.
Let's start by loading all the libraries we'll need and the data available on this github
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, requireNamespace("DT", quietly=TRUE)}

library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(GGally)
library(gt)
library(e1071)
library(caret)
library(skimr)
library(DALEX)

df <- read_delim("diabetes.csv", delim = ";",
escape_double    =    FALSE,    col_types    =    cols(Outcome    =    col_factor(levels    =
c("0",
"1"))),    trim_ws    =    TRUE)
DT::datatable(head(df), fillContainer = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 4))
```

Analysis of the table reveals no missing values and generally high standard deviations, especially for the standard deviations, especially for the amount of Insulin in the blood

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df <- read_delim("diabetes.csv", delim = ";",
escape_double    =    FALSE,    col_types    =    cols(Outcome    =    col_factor(levels    =
c("0",
"1"))),    trim_ws    =    TRUE)

my_skim    <-    skim_with(numeric    =    sfl(    p50    =    NULL,hist=NULL,    n_missing=NULL,    complete_rate=  NULL,p25=NULL    ,p75=NULL))
                                                 
diabetes_df    <-    my_skim(df[,-9])
diabetes_df    %>% 
select(-skim_type)            %>% 
gt()    %>%
cols_label(
numeric.mean    =    "Moyenne",    numeric.sd    =    "Ecart-type",
numeric.p0    =    "Min"    ,
numeric.p100    =    "Max")    %>%
opt_stylize(style    =    6,    color    =    "cyan",    add_row_striping    =    TRUE)    %>% 
tab_header(title    =    "Summary    of    Variables    in    the    diabetes    data")

```

Analysis of the table reveals no missing values and generally high standard deviations, especially 
standard deviations, especially for the amount of Insulin in the blood.

When we analyze the density of each of the variables distributed according to Outcome, we see a phase shift between the curves for 1 and those for 0. In fact, these diagonal figures show that all the variables selected are important in the detection of diabetes. However, it can be seen that the quantity of glucose in the blood  and age could be highly determinant of diabetes.

A very important first step is to normalize the values of the quantitative variables.  We'll use min-max normalization. This process transforms variables so that all values lie within the range between 0 and 1.

We'll split our data into two parts.    Let's reserve 80% for training and 20% for model testing. 
model testing.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
split_size        =            0.80
sample_size    =            floor(split_size                *            nrow(df)) 
set.seed(563)
train_indices <- sample(seq_len(nrow(df)), size =
sample_size)
train <- df[train_indices, ] 
test <- df[-train_indices, ]
```

We'll use the train function to find our model. Using random search and cross validation we'll determine the parameters of our model. Random search is often efficient, as it explores the space of hyperparameters randomly rather than systematically systematically like simple search. This enables us to cover a wider range of hyperparameter combinations of hyperparameters in fewer iterations.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(023)
grid    <-    expand.grid(    sigma=runif(25,0.1,30)    ,        C    =    runif(25,    0.1,    30))
tuned_model    <-    train(Outcome    ~    .,    data    =    train,    method =  'svmRadial',    tuneGrid    =    grid, trControl= trainControl(method    =    'cv',    number    =    5))

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```

---
We can see the average accuracy during the search for our parameters.   It is 0.75 .
Now we'll build the final model using the parameters previously determined

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
final_model <- svm(Outcome ~ ., data = train, kernel = 'radial', cost = tuned_model$bestTune$C,probability = TRUE)
```

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Predictions <- predict(final_model, newdata = train)
conf_matrix <- table(Predictions, train$Outcome)
Accuracy <- sum(diag(conf_matrix)) / sum(conf_matrix) 
print(paste('The model achieves classification at', Accuracy*100,'%'))
```

---

### Prediction and evaluation

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
predictions    <-    predict(final_model,    newdata    =    test) 
matrixx    <-    table(predictions,    test$Outcome)
confusionMatrix(matrixx,mode    =    "everything")
```

---

To evaluate the model, we're not going to use only accuracy, commonly known as __Accuracy__, because of the class imbalance in our dataset: $65$%  of the data are from non-diabetics.

The **recall** of our model is **82.35%**. This means that the model is better at predicting the cases of people without diabetes. Otherwise, there's a small chance that the model will be wrong about a person who doesn't have diabetes. However, the percentage of people wrongly classified as diabetic is quite high. So $$a=1- Specificity$$ $$ a=53.41% $$  

Overall, the estimated model gives good predictions on the dataset, taking **Recall** and **F1** as metrics.

#### The best predictors

Using the `explain` and `model_parts` functions from **(Biecek 2018)**, we'll highlight the variables that have the greatest importance in the design of our model.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE }
ex <- explain(final_model,data=train, y=as.numeric( train$Outcome),predict_function = predict,predict_function_target_column = predictions)
```

## Conclusion

SVMs have a number of advantages compared to other ML algorithms. First oÔ¨Ä, they attempt to directly maximize generalizability (i.e., accuracy). Since SVMs are essentially just convex optimization problems, we‚Äôre always guaranteed to Ô¨Ånd a global optimum (as opposed to potentially getting stuck in local optima as with DNNs). By softening the margin using a budget (or cost) parameter (ùê∂), SVMs are relatively robust to outliers. And Ô¨Ånally, using kernel functions, SVMs are Ô¨Çexible enough to adapt to complex nonlinear decision boundaries (i.e., they can Ô¨Çexibly model nonlinear relationships). 
However, SVMs do carry a few disadvantages as well.  Lastly, special procedures (e.g., OVA and OVO) have to be used to handle multinomial classiÔ¨Åcation problems with SVMs.
